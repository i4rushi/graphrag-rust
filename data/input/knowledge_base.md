# Machine Learning Systems

## Neural Networks

Deep learning models like GPT-4 are built by OpenAI. These models use transformer architecture invented by Google researchers in 2017.

## Training Infrastructure

OpenAI uses Microsoft Azure for training. The partnership began in 2019 and involves billions in compute resources.

## Applications

ChatGPT, launched in November 2022, uses GPT-3.5 and later GPT-4. It was developed by the OpenAI team led by Sam Altman.

## Competition

Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI researchers including Dario Amodei, created Claude. Google developed Bard (now Gemini).

## Technical Details

Transformers use attention mechanisms. This allows them to process sequences efficiently. NVIDIA GPUs power most training.
