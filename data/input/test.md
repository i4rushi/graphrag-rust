# Introduction to GraphRAG

GraphRAG combines the power of graph databases with retrieval augmented generation.

## Key Concepts

Vector embeddings allow us to find semantically similar content. Graph structures capture relationships between entities.

## Implementation

The system processes documents in several stages:
- Ingestion and chunking
- Entity extraction
- Graph indexing
- Query processing

This allows for both local and global search capabilities.
